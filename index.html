T&nbsp;hose W&nbsp;ho C&nbsp;an’t
T&nbsp;aylor F&nbsp;ranson-T&nbsp;hiel
I will teach my daughter how to carry
the body of her mother west
stepping over the R&nbsp;ockies
to bury her
beneath the red chest of U&nbsp;tah’s desert.
C&nbsp;up my hands over hers as she
smooths oxidized dirt
careful to cover the
face first
if it makes her feel better. S&nbsp;he will learn
how all daughters of our lineage bury
sins of unrepentant mothers.
T&nbsp;he line of graves,
a long ribcage.
