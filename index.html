<h1>Those Who Can’t<h1>

<p> I <i>will</i> teach my daughter how to carry
the body of her mother west
stepping over the <b>Rockies</b>
to bury her
beneath the red chest of <b>Utah’s</b> desert.
Cup my hands over hers as she
<li>smooths oxidized dirt
careful to cover the
face first</li>
if it makes her feel better. She will learn
how all daughters of our lineage bury
sins of unrepentant mothers.
The line of graves,
a long ribcage.</p>
