<p> There's a loving in your eyes all the way
If I listened to your lies would you say <p>

<p> I'm a man without conviction
I'm a man who doesn't know
How to sell a contradiction
You come and go
You come and go <p>

<p> Karma Karma Karma Karma Karma Chameleon
You come and go
You come and go
Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dream
Red, gold and green
Red, gold and green <p>

<p> Didn't hear your wicked words every day
And you used to be so sweet I heard you say <p>

<p> That my love was an addiction
When we cling our love is strong
When you go you're gone forever
You string along
You string along <p>

<p> Karma Karma Karma Karma Karma Chameleon
You come and go
You come and go
Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dream
Red, gold and green
Red, gold and green <p>

<p> Every day is like survival
You're my lover not my rival
Every day is like survival
You're my lover not my rival <p>

<p> I'm a man without conviction
I'm a man who doesn't know
How to sell a contradiction
You come and go
You come and go <p>

<p> Karma Karma Karma Karma Karma Chameleon
You come and go
You come and go
Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dream
Red, gold and green
Red, gold and green
Karma Karma Karma Karma Karma Chameleon
You come and go
You come and go
Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dream
Red, gold and green
Red, gold and green
Karma Karma Karma Karma Karma Chameleon
You come and go
You come and go
Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dream
Red, gold and green
Red, gold and green
Karma Karma Karma Karma Karma Chameleon
You come and go
You come and go
Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dream
Red, gold and green
Red, gold and green <p>
